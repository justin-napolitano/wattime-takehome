# Introduction 

## Thank You

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on something that I am passionate about.  I also had a lot of fun experimenting with the data and learning some new skills along the way. 

## About This Document

This document is a sample of the type of work that I like to create. I used the Jupyter Book Packages [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) to build the website and the PDF document.  I like working with this suite and Sphinx because it integrates well with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.  There are other options available such Gatsby, but that requires more manual tinkering than I had time to complete.  

## Sections

You will find code and no code blog post examples, data exploration/preperation notebooks that I kept to document my thinking, and an analysis of the University of Malaysia paper provided to me.  
 
The scripts I used to prepare the data are found in the data exploration section


Check out my work below.

## Discussion

### Limiting myself to 300 - 500 words.  

I found it difficult to not write a thesis paper.  The data exploration notebooks document my journey through the data.  My intention was to recreate the Climate Trace article provided to me, test the claims, and review the emissions conversion rates methodology.  That work is preserved in the analysis and data exploration sections.  

The final post that I prepared feels short, despite not having delved into the depths of the analysis.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the challenge. 

### Things I would have Done Differently

I would have begun this process by clearly identifying my audience.  Without that in mind, I struggled to formulate an argument.  

I would also like to have read the literature to a greater extent in order to cite statements in my post that I felt were under researched. 

### Things left to Do


#### Data Pipeline

With unlimited time, I would have like to compile my data manipulation processes into a data pipeline program to automate the process without the jupyter overhead.  It would better facilitate distributing the repository via github for other researchers to explore.

#### Bibliography

Including a bibliography is a feature supported by Jupyter Book.  Unfortunately, it can be finicky.  I would have liked to include a references section that links to the cited documents.  

#### 20 and 100 Year Warming Potentials

I would have liked to make an argument supporiting including co2equiv in the 20 and 100 year warming potentials measure, but I did not feel authorized to do so.  I worried about making an argument that was inaccurate due a lack of exposure to the literature.   A full literature review would have been necessary in my opinion to make a valid argument.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time nor the space to do so.  

### Publish the Website

I chose not to publish the site publicaly at the request of the instructions.  I've prepared methane.jnapolitano.io for deployment to publish this site when permitted to do so.
