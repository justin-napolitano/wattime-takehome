    "According to the United Nations Environment Program \"methane is the primary contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone.\" Over 20 years, \"it is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide.\" a hazardous air pollutant and greenhouse gas, exposure to which causes 1 million premature deaths every year. Methane is also a powerful greenhouse gas. Over a 20-year period, it is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide [(UNEP)](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them).  In fact, one kilogram of CH4 produced is equivalent to 25 kilograms of CO2.[(Econometra)[https://ecometrica.com/assets/GHGs-CO2-CO2e-and-Carbon-What-Do-These-Mean-v2.1.pdf].  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agricultural industry is the primary producer of methane emissions globally.  While the cattle industry is a well known culprit, paddy rice cultivation – in which flooded fields prevent oxygen from penetrating the soil, creating ideal conditions for methane-emitting bacteria – accounts for another 8 per cent of human-linked emissions.[source](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them).  This equates to an average insert equivalency here to rice cultivation.  \n"

FAOSTAT relies on government reported values that may be manipulated to increase assistance from Non governmental organizations and foreign governments.  TRACE data may not accurately capture small fields or paddies at high elevation due to limitted specificity(not the word i want but it will come back to me) of satellite images.  \n"
