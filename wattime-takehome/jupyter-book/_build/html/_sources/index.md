# Introduction 


## About

Rice Paddies produce about 8 percent of global methane emissions. In this report I identify the greatest contributors to harmful emissions and compare estimation methodologies.  

## Inspiration

The University of Malaysia prepared a report that stated that the UN under reports methane emissions by about 16 percent.  I found their methodology to be wanting.  I therefore tested the report by recreating their papers and testing across multiple distributions.  

You will find that work along with blog posts summarizing my findings below:
