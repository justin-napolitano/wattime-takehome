## Title: 

* Are we undercounting Methane Emissions?
* Rice Cultivation and Methane Emissions:

What is the spin? Shall I write a technical article or a viral piece? 

I am leaning towards a technical paper, that can be rewrittenfor  sharing. 

## Argument

### Question:

* Are we undercounting Methane Emisssions
* What is the best method for Calculating methane emissions
* What is the impact of methane emissions from rice cultivation? **** This is the one

### Methane C02 equivalency

Begin the paper with an argument for considering the impact of ch4 in climate models.  

Discuss the importance and the cite an expert. 

### Lead into the FAOSTAT and TRACE data

Ie how do we calculate Methane emissions?

* Calculating Hectarres of cultivate(how is this done by fao and trace) 
    do they differ?
* Hectares of cultivation * conversion factor (which conversion factor is better to use?)
    test for differnce
    How greatly do they differ

* converting to co2 equivalency
    convert both to the co2 equivalency to identify the variation. Test for difference.  


### Which conversion factor is better with everything else being equal.
The data does not differ greatly.  The distributionss are fairly close annualy and will most likely show that both methods have errors.

The unfortunate crux of the argument is the conversion factor.  With everything else being equal the conversion factor will be the most important differential.  

Why is one better than the other

### Conclude that ch4 emissions are equivalent to x tonnes of co2 base on conversion factor 

The difference between the methods is moot

In general rice production produces a large amount of ch4 emissions regardless of the factor
