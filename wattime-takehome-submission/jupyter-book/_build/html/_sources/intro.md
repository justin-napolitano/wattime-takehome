# Introduction

This document is a sample of the type of work that I like to create.  You'll find some blog posts that I prepared, data exploration/preperation notebooks that I kept to document my thinking, and an analysis of the University of Malaysia paper provided to me.  

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on something that I am passionate about.  I also had a lot of fun experimenting with the data and learning some new skills along the way.  

I found working with the data and analyzing the results of the paper to be very enjoyable.  Writing a 300-500 word blog post was unexpectedly difficult.  

Check out my work below.
